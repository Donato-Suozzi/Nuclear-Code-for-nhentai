Welcome random person of the internet, are you ok?
Anyway welcome to my first doo doo project.
I don't know why are you here, but thanks for been here. :D
Reurning on the project, the code is simple and is created by a ooga booga cave man brain, so isn't the best, but do his work.
There is one big problem and is that it works with the number generetor, so sometimes appers on the site of nhentai.net the error 404.
You can fix the APPARENTLY bug by re-run it, until generates a REAL RANDOM hen-*coff* *coff* "JAPANESE ART" *coff* *coff*.
BUT you can change the minimum and the maximum number for a better research. ;-)
Sometimes doesn't work if the browser is closed (expecially Opera GX), so i recommend to open your default browser, but you can not do it and sometimes works well. 
One day I will create an interface or something like that and some brand new things that actually I don't know.
And remember: "Stay in School, Smoke Crack, Fuck You Depression, Bye!"
