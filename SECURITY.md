## Reporting Anything

In the "Issue" section please follow the tag instruction.

If you spot a vulnerability or a bug in the code, please submit the problem in the correct tag.

The Tags are stored in this method:
  - Bug: This should be used for a bug orproblem in the software
  - Help Wanted: This should be used for a serious bug or a serious problem of vulnerability from the code.
  - Good First Issue: This should be used in Pre-Releases or in fresh new update to inform me about a problem with the changed code.
  - Documentation: This should be used if the documentation of the release is not ok or it doesn't specify a part.

Other Tags can be divided into 3 groups: Catalogue and Opinions

The Opinion tags are used for submit questions or ideas:
  - Enhancement: This tag should be used for suggest a new idea or a new path for the project
  - Question: This tag should be used for a question about the project or a part of it.

Instead, the Catalogue tags are used by the admin to some topics:
  - Duplicate: This topic is similiar to another topic, so most of the time you will be resend back to the discussion
  - Invalid: The topic is too generic or something else, but it isn't comprhensible at all, so it is an invalid discussion.
  - Wontfix: This bug or this idea will not be taken as an idea, because it can't be put inside the project.

I hope you can understand and send your ideas on the project.
